📊 Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews using VADER

This project performs sentiment analysis on amazon product reviews using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool from NLTK.
The analysis includes visualizations of sentiment scores and insights derived from customer review ratings (1–5 stars).

🔍Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze customer sentiment from review text and explore how sentiment correlates with user-provided star ratings. The dataset is uploaded in ZIP format containing a CSV file with product reviews and star scores.

Using VADER, we extract positive, neutral, negative, and compound sentiment scores for each review. These are then analyzed and visualized using bar plots for deeper insight into review patterns and customer satisfaction.
